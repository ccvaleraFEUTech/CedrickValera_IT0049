# CodeIgniter 4 Application Starter

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

You can read the [user guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/)
corresponding to the latest version of the framework.

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use GitHub issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.

## Overview

A four-page CodeIgniter 4 application built as the first version of a basic Point-of-Sale (POS) system. This activity focuses on routing, controllers, and views — no database is used yet. The Customer Accounts and User Accounts pages use static PHP arrays as a temporary, in-memory data source.

- `app/Controllers/Pages.php` — handles the landing and about pages
- `app/Controllers/Customers.php` — holds the static customer array and passes it to the view
- `app/Controllers/Users.php` — holds the static user array and passes it to the view
- `app/Views/pages/` — landing and about page templates
- `app/Views/customers/index.php` — loops through the customer array with `foreach`
- `app/Views/users/index.php` — loops through the user array with `foreach`
- `app/Config/Routes.php` — registers all four routes
